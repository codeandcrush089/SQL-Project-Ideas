# Project 1: **Retail Sales Performance Analysis (‚ÄúGlobal Superstore‚Äù)**

### 1. Dataset

* **Name**: Global Superstore / Superstore Sales

* **Source**: Kaggle

* **Contents / Attributes**: Typical columns include:

  * Order ID, Order Date, Ship Date
  * Customer ID, Customer Segment, Region / State / City
  * Product ID, Product Category, Sub-Category, Product Name
  * Sales, Quantity, Discount, Profit
  * Ship Mode or Shipping Type

* **Time Period**: Usually multiple years of sales data (e.g. 4 years) ([Kaggle][1])

### 2. Project Objective

Analyze sales operations for the superstore to derive insights on performance, profitability, product success, customer behavior, and geographic trends. The goal is to support decision-making: which products to promote, where to open more stores, how to improve shipping / discount strategy, etc.


### 3. Skills Used

* SQL Joins (inner, left, etc.)
* Aggregations (SUM, AVG, COUNT)
* Group By, Having clauses
* Window Functions (ROW\_NUMBER, RANK, PARTITION BY, etc.)
* Date/time functions (extracting year, month, quarter; handling date differences)
* CASE statements (for conditional bucketing)
* Subqueries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
* Possibly user-defined functions or stored procedures (if scaling or repeated tasks)


### 4. Tasks / SQL Queries to Do

| 8  | **Profit Loss by Products (or negative profits)**  | - Find products or categories where profit is negative. <br> - Compute how much loss, possibly suggest discontinuation or cost-review. <br> *Sample SQL:*<br> `sql SELECT ProductName, SUM(Profit) AS TotalProfit FROM Orders GROUP BY ProductName HAVING SUM(Profit) < 0 ORDER BY TotalProfit; `                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 9  | **Discount vs. Quantity sold**                     | - Do higher discounts lead to significantly more quantity sold? <br> - Is there a break-even point where discount hurts profit more than it drives sales? <br> *Sample SQL:*<br> `sql SELECT DiscountBucket, SUM(Quantity) AS TotalQty, SUM(Profit) AS TotalProfit FROM Orders GROUP BY DiscountBucket ORDER BY DiscountBucket; `                                                                                                                                                 |

* Write stored procedures for repeating tasks: e.g. updating monthly profit & loss dashboards
* Use window functions for ranking: e.g., rank products per category by profit or sales
* Handle data quality issues: missing dates, unbalanced data, outliers (e.g. negative sales or weird discounts)
* Partitioning / indexing if dataset large ‚Üí to speed up queries


### 6. Possible Dashboard or Reporting Outputs

* Monthly dashboard with ‚ÄúSales vs Profit vs Quantity‚Äù
* Top N Products by Region / Category
* Heatmap of sales by state / city
